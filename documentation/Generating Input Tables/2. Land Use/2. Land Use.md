![bzone_carsvc_availability](https://github.com/VisionEval/VisionEval-Docs/blob/master/tutorials/verspm/images/bzone_carsvc_availability.PNG)

### Sourcing - TBD
For each bzone, determine a high or low service relative to private car service. 'High' would be that car service access times are competitive with private car ownership. Hard to say what the source would be here. We might look at [Uber](https://movement.uber.com/cities?lang=en-US) or Lyft availability by some sort of land use typology right now (if we can get the data) and then create some assumptions about how availability by typology might differ in the future based on a scenario and future land use typology.

**Geo Determination:** block group or TAZ. Perhaps based on typology method

# AssignDemandManagement Module

## bzone_travel_demand_mgt.csv ❇️

>This file contains the information about workers and households participating in demand management programs and is used in the AssignDemandManagement module. For each block group or TAZ, in base and horizon years, we will need to fill out two fields.
>- _EcoProp_ - Proportion of workers working in Bzone who participate in strong employee commute options program
>- _ImpProp_ - Proportion of households residing in Bzone who participate in strong individualized marketing program

[Input Documentation](https://github.com/visioneval/VisionEval/blob/master/sources/modules/VELandUse/inst/module_docs/AssignDemandManagement.md#bzone_travel_demand_mgtcsv)

### Sourcing - TBD
Regardless of a TAZ or block group Bzone, this is going to be difficult to get any observed data at such a small geopgraphy. If it's in the DVRPC 2012-2013 DVRPC Household Travel Survey (HTS) at all, the survey itself is not supposed to be used for subcounty analysis. We didn't get a sample household for every block group or TAZ and certainly not a good enough sample in any single small geo to expand the sample to represent its block group or TAZ. 

We should reach out to Stacy Bartels, Manager of Office of TDM Strategy and Marketing, to find out if any survey has been done for her transportation demand managment programs to have something that has more detailed information. Perhaps there are some demographic attributes of respondents that could help us make some assumptions on likelihood of participation in one of these programs based on BG/TAZ attributes.


**Geo Determination:** block group or TAZ will be hard but we'll see what Stacy or the HTS have to offer.

# AssignLocTypes module

### Sourcing - 🏙️ UrbanSim Model Outputs
#### _Typology Classifcations_
We'll need to define our approach of determining place type classifications like urban and town area. If this method can be applied to UrbanSim data, it can be applied to both base and horizon year. A VADOT team created some methodologies for this based on Claritas data and other research/considerations taking population densities of TAZs and using Fairfax county's zones density percentiles to designate urban (75+) suburban (40-74) town (20-39) and rural (0-19). More details are found in the document they produced called: LocationTypeAzonesMarch09Clean.docx

Brett Fusco, Ben Gruswitz, and RSG's Mark Bradley developed a Claritas-like typology to classify tracts for an update to Mark's Impacts 2050 model in 2019. TAZs with their centroids in these tracts were designated by these typologies and block groups could be also take on the classifications of their parent tracts. This would be the easiest entry point for a base-year designation, but the data year would need to be reviewed. The methods could also be reviewed and applied to block groups, TAZs, or blocks using UrbanSim results for base and horizon years.

Brian Gregor (father of RSPM and other VisionEval models) came up with an interesting way to classify what he called Place Types using the EPA's Smart Location Database (SLD) in his [Placetypes_USA repository](https://github.com/gregorbj/Placetypes_USA). However, if we could apply this, we'd have to do it on SLD data, not base and horizon UrbanSim results. To apply it to UrbanSim outputs, we'd have to dig into the [SLD methodology](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2021-06/documents/epa_sld_3.0_technicaldocumentationuserguide_may2021.pdf) and see if we could script something that would substitute their data sources between UrbanSim and travel model outputs. On the travel model side, this could only be done for a baseline scenario, since we wouldn't be running it and building detailed networks within it for scenario planning (That's the whole reason for using VisionEval). Perhaps those horizon networks would remain static and demographic data would change from UrbanSim scenarios, but that's not desirable. Perhaps some scaling factors could be applied to the metrics of the travel models for the scenarios, but it would be difficult to figure out plausible adjustments to TAZ or block data per scenario.

I'd also like to see about UrbanSim supplying all the data need for the Calculate4DMeasures model, including the internal inputs described [here](https://github.com/visioneval/VisionEval/blob/master/sources/modules/VELandUse/inst/module_docs/Calculate4DMeasures.md#how-the-module-works). Perhaps this could be followed up with the Placetypes_USA script to determine the typology.

If the urban or town classification is designated for the entirety of the Bzone, if the zone is urban and it contained single-family units, wouldn't the proportion of single-family units be 100%? If zones have urban and non-urban portions, wouldn't the urban/rural classification need to be determined at sub Bzone geographies such as census blocks?

#### _DU and GQ_
SF and MF units can be pulled from the UrbanSim h5 export of a simulation for base and horizon years. 

The terms "GQDU" and "group quarters accomodations" don't sound exactly like group quarters populatio--the metric reported by the Census Bureau and added as a static variable in UrbanSim. If it's a count of facilities or rooms within facilities, that's a very different metric that I wouldn't know how to come by. Also, is GQ all GQ, or just non-institutional GQ?

**Geo Determination:** So far nothing restricting either block group or TAZ but perhaps an SLD-based typology would lean block group for Bzone.

>- _PkgCost_ - Average daily cost for long-term parking (e.g. paid on monthly basis)


[Input Documentation](https://github.com/visioneval/VisionEval/blob/master/sources/modules/VELandUse/inst/module_docs/AssignParkingRestrictions.md#bzone_parkingcsv)

### Sourcing - TBD (blanket assumptions?)
Could investigate what HTS or Stacy Bartels may have but SACOG and others made some general assumptions. Averages from sample data could be starting point. See document: VERSPM Input Preparation - SACOG.docx, bzone_parkingNotesJan24.docx

Check for MF rates from Svekla and Derek.

Could use land use inventory but not structure/lot distinction. No info on free or not but could assume Philly is free. Or everything but little downtown areas (Narberth, Norristown, Mainline towns)

Fixed assumptions would be an appropriate starting point and this could be improved later.

8/25 Updates (Fiza): The file in the shared drive contains values for all columns except _PropWkrPay_,_PropCashOut_ and _PkgCost_

# Calculate4DMeasures module

## bzone_network_design.csv ❇️

>This file contains the intersection density in terms of pedestrian-oriented intersections having four or more legs per square mile and is used in the Calculate4DMeasures module. For each block group or TAZ, in base and horizon years, we will need to fill out one field.
>- _D3bpo4_ - Intersection density in terms of pedestrian-oriented intersections having four or more legs per square mile (Ref: EPA 2010 Smart Location Database)

[Input Documentation](https://github.com/visioneval/VisionEval/blob/master/sources/modules/VELandUse/inst/module_docs/Calculate4DMeasures.md#bzone_network_designcsv)

### Sourcing - Block: SLD; TAZ: SLD methods applied to TIM2 Network
An easy download from the SLD by block group may be the most compelling reason to use block groups for Bzones. We can access it [here](https://geodata.epa.gov/arcgis/rest/services/OA/SmartLocationDatabase/MapServer/14). Would have to look into how to apply the [SLD methods](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2021-06/documents/epa_sld_3.0_technicaldocumentationuserguide_may2021.pdf) (pp. 29-22) to the travel model network and cut by TAZ, otherwise.

>- Updates 08/25 (Fiza): will be using the _d3bpo4_ (ex. see column 94 in sld_34005_lyr10) for both 2019 and 2050. Data from this column can be exported alongside Geo-Bzone and Year

**Geo Determination:** Leans block group

## bzone_unprotected_area.csv ❇️

### Sourcing - Land Use/Protected Open Space layers from UrbanSim inputs
We developed LU/POS vector data from our 2015 inventory of land use and 2016/2017 POS inventory. We have the information by block, I believe, so we should be able to aggregate within whatever land use typology we use for Urban, Town, and Rural.

There's a new 2019 LU inventory.

**Geo Determination:** block group or TAZ are equally easy to get.

# CalculateUrbanMixMeasure module

>- _MixUseProp_ - Target for proportion of households located in mixed-use neighborhoods in zone (or NA if no target)

[Input Documentation](https://github.com/visioneval/VisionEval/blob/master/sources/modules/VELandUse/inst/module_docs/CalculateUrbanMixMeasure.md#bzone_urban-mixed-use_propcs)

### Sourcing - Not necessary at the moment
Targets could be developed later if we wish to have any targets for how much mixed use should exist in Bzones. For now we can populate with all NAs like other agencies seem to be doing.

**Geo Determination:** block group or TAZ are equally easy to prescribe targets to.
