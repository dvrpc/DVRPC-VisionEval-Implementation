## bzone_transit_service.csv ❇️

>- _D4c_ - Aggregate frequency of transit service within 0.25 miles of block group boundary per hour during evening peak period (Ref: EPA 2010 Smart Location Database)

### Sourcing - SLD
Another reason for building block group Bzones, at least initially. If TAZ Bzones become compelling, we can figure out the [SLD methodology](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2021-06/documents/epa_sld_3.0_technicaldocumentationuserguide_may2021.pdf) and apply it to the travel model transit schedules, considering the time period adjustments made for AM, MD, PM, and NT from GTFS. We can use the conformity forecast aggregate frequency for a baseline in the horizon year. But for now, we can just get this [here](https://geodata.epa.gov/arcgis/rest/services/OA/SmartLocationDatabase/MapServer/14).
